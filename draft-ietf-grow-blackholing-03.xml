                Gateway Protocol (BGP) community for destination-based
                blackholing in IP networks. This well-known advisory
                transitive BGP community named BLACKHOLE allows an origin
                AS to specify that a neighboring network should discard
                any traffic destined towards the tagged IP prefix.

            <t>
                Network infrastructures have been increasingly hampered
                by DDoS attacks. In order to dampen the effects of these
                DDoS attacks, IP networks have offered blackholing with
                <xref target="RFC4271">BGP</xref> using various mechanisms
                such as those described in <xref target="RFC3882"/> and
                <xref target="RFC5635"/>.
            </t>

            <t>
                DDoS attacks targeting a certain IP address may cause
                congestion of links used to connect to other networks. In order
                to limit the impact of such a scenario on legitimate traffic,
                networks adopted a mechanism called BGP blackholing. A network
                that wants to trigger blackholing needs to understand the
                triggering mechanism adopted by its neighboring networks.
                Different networks provide different mechanisms to trigger
                blackholing, including but not limited to pre-defined blackhole
                next-hop IP addresses, specific BGP communities or via an
                out-of-band BGP session with a special BGP speaker.
            </t>

            <t>
                Having several different mechanisms to trigger blackholing in
                different networks makes it an unnecessarily complex,
                error-prone and cumbersome task for network operators.
                Therefore, a well-known <xref target="RFC1997">BGP
                community</xref> is defined for operational ease.
            </t>

            <t>
                Having such a well-known BGP community for blackholing also
                further simplifies network operations because:
                <list style='symbols'>
                    <t>Implementing and monitoring blackholing becomes easier
                       when implementation, and operational guides do not cover
                       many options that trigger blackholing.
                    </t>
                    <t>The number of support requests from customers about how
                       to trigger blackholing in a particular neighboring
                       network will be reduced as the codepoint for common
                       blackholing mechanisms is unified and well-known.
                    </t>
                </list>
            </t>

            <t>
                Making it considerably easier for network operators to utilize
                blackholing makes operations easier.

                   The semantics of this community allow a network to interpret

                <t>
                    When a network is under DDoS duress, it MAY announce
                    an IP prefix covering the victim's IP address(es)
                    for the purpose of signaling to neighboring networks
                    that any traffic destined for these IP address(es)
                    should be discarded. In such a scenario, the network
                    operator SHOULD attach the BLACKHOLE BGP community.
                    This community MAY be used in all BGP deployment
                    scenarios, for example between network providers or
                    with an IXP's route server.

                    A BGP speaker receiving an announcement tagged
                    with the BLACKHOLE community SHOULD add the
                    NO_ADVERTISE or NO_EXPORT community as defined in
                    <xref target="RFC1997"/>, or a similar community to
                    prevent propagation of the prefix outside the local AS.
                    The community to prevent propagation SHOULD be chosen
                    according to the operator's routing policy.

                    Unintentional leaking of more specific IP prefixes to
                    neighboring networks can have adverse effects. Extreme
                    caution should be used when purposefully propagating
                    IP prefixes tagged with the BLACKHOLE BGP community
                    outside the local routing domain, unless policy
                    explicitly aims at doing just that.

                <t>
                    It has been observed in provider networks running BGP
                    that announcements of IP prefixes longer than /24
                    for IPv4 and /48 for IPv6 are usually not accepted
                    on the Internet (see <xref target="RFC7454">section
                    6.1.3</xref>). However, blackhole prefix length should
                    be as long as possible in order to limit the impact
                    of discarding traffic for adjacent IP space that is
                    not under DDoS duress. The blackhole prefix length is
                    typically as specific as possible, a /32 for IPv4 or
                    a /128 for IPv6.

                <t>
                    BGP speakers in a direct peering relationship MUST
                    only accept BGP announcements carrying the BLACKHOLE
                    community, if the announced prefix is covered by
                    a shorter prefix that the neighboring network is
                    authorized to advertise. In topologies with a route
                    server or other multilateral peering relationships,
                    BGP speakers SHOULD accept BGP announcements under
                    the same conditions.

                BGP contains no specific mechanism to prevent the unauthorized

                allows routing information to be modified, removed, or false
                information to be added by forwarding agents. Recipients of
                routing information are not able to detect this modification.

                that the peer announcing the prefix is authorized to do so. If
